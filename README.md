Ethernet Power Switch
=====================

Switch the power of up to 8 grid connected devices using your web browser or REST API.

Based on a Arduino Mega with Ethernet shield.

The code probably runs as well on newer hardware that is more common nowadays (But I had these hardware laying around).

I'd like to thank:
